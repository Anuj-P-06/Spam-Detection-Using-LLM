# Spam Detection Using LLM

This project implements a spam detection system using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model to classify SMS messages as "Spam" or "Not Spam." It includes:

- **`fine_tune.py`**: Python script for training and fine-tuning the DistilBERT model on a spam dataset.
- **`app.py`**: Streamlit web app for making predictions on new messages.

## Overview

This system leverages **DistilBERT**, a lightweight transformer model, fine-tuned on an SMS message dataset to classify messages as spam or not. It offers an efficient solution for filtering unwanted or harmful content in real-time.

## Problem Statement and Objectives

### Problem Statement

The increasing volume of SMS communications necessitates effective filtering of unwanted or malicious messages. Traditional spam filters often struggle against modern spam tactics. By utilizing transformer-based models like DistilBERT, this system provides a more accurate and robust solution.

### Objectives

1. Develop a high-performing spam classification model using a fine-tuned DistilBERT.
2. Create a user-friendly web app for real-time spam detection.
3. Demonstrate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in text classification tasks.

## Proposed System

The proposed system uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT transformer model to classify SMS messages as "Spam" or "Not Spam." The system includes the following components:

1. **Training Pipeline**: Fine-tunes the DistilBERT model for spam classification.
2. **Prediction Interface**: A Streamlit web app that classifies SMS messages in real-time.

## Modules

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Loads the SMS spam dataset.
- Tokenizes the data using DistilBERT's tokenizer.

### 2. Model Fine-Tuning
- Fine-tunes the DistilBERT model for binary classification (Spam vs Not Spam).

### 3. Evaluation
- Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using a validation set.

### 4. Web Application
- Streamlit-based app for making real-time predictions.

## Key Files

- **`fine_tune.py`**: Fine-tunes the DistilBERT model on the SMS spam dataset.
- **`app.py`**: Streamlit web app that loads the fine-tuned model for real-time predictions.
